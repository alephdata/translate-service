# Translation service

This service exists mainly as a way to demonstrate how you can add new
stages to Aleph's document processing, especially for NLP.

See: https://docs.alephdata.org/developers/adding-text-processors

**IMPORTANT:** this is not meant to be a working implementation of
translation for Aleph. If you want to fix it up to be production-grade,
that would be great. But don't run it in prodcution like this, please.
